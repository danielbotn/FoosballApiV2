# Development

Run the project with the following command

```sh
dotnet run
```

The project run on port `5297` --> `https://localhost:5297/swagger/index.html`

The project runs on docker on port `8080`

## Env variables

Secrets are added to `secrets.json` file with `dotnet user-secrets`

To run the project. The following variables are needed

```json
{
  "SmtpUser": "",
  "SmtpPort": "",
  "SmtpPass": "",
  "SmtpHost": "",
  "SmtpEmailFrom": "",
  "JwtSecret": "",
  "DatoCmsBearer": "",
  "FoosballDbDev": "",
  "FoosballDbProd": ""
}
```

## Technology

[.net core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
[Dapper] (https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper)
[postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Code Rules

To come.
Remember to format the code using `dotnet-format`

First install `dotnet-format` globally on your machine:

```sh
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-format
```

Then format the code using:

```sh
dotnet format
```

## PATCH REQUESTS

when doing patch requests. Have the body something like this:

```json
[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/Name",
    "value": "Some new name"
  }
]
```

## Triggers

A couple of Postgres triggers are used in the system. Here are the complete up to date list of all the triggers.

## add_single_league_goal()

This function updates the single_league_matches table after on insert on the single_league_goals table

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_single_league_goal()
RETURNS trigger AS
$$
DECLARE
  player_one_select integer := null;
  player_two_select integer := null;
  start_time_first timestamp := null;
BEGIN
	SELECT player_one into player_one_select FROM single_league_matches where id = new.match_id and player_one = new.scored_by_user_id;
	SELECT player_two into player_two_select FROM single_league_matches where id = new.match_id and player_two = new.scored_by_user_id;
	SELECT start_time into start_time_first FROM single_league_matches where id = new.match_id;

	if (player_one_select is not NULL) then
		update single_league_matches
		SET player_one_score = new.scorer_score
		where id = new.match_id;
	end if;

	if (player_two_select is not NULL) then
		update single_league_matches
		SET player_two_score = new.scorer_score
		where id = new.match_id;
	end if;

	if (new.winner_goal = true) then
		update single_league_matches
		SET match_ended = true
		where id = new.match_id;
	end if;

	if (start_time_first is null) then
		update single_league_matches
		set start_time = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, match_started = true
		where id = new.match_id;
	end if;

	RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER add_single_league_goal
AFTER INSERT
ON single_league_goals
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE add_single_league_goal();
```

## create_single_league_matches

This function runs after the single_league table is updated

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_single_league_matches()
RETURNS trigger AS
$$
DECLARE
  user_ids integer[] := null;
  i integer;
  iterator integer := 0;
  array_length integer;
  counter integer := 0;
  counterMax integer := 2;
BEGIN
	if (NEW.has_league_started = true and OLD.has_league_started = false and old.type_of_league = 'single_league') then
		SELECT INTO user_ids array_agg(user_id) FROM league_players WHERE league_id = OLD.id;
		SELECT INTO array_length count(id) FROM league_players WHERE league_id = OLD.id;
		SELECT INTO counterMax how_many_rounds FROM leagues WHERE id = OLD.id;
		if (counterMax is NULL) then
			counterMax := 2;
		end if;
		LOOP
			exit when counter = counterMax;
			counter := counter + 1 ;
			iterator := 0;
			FOREACH i IN ARRAY user_ids
			LOOP
			iterator := iterator + 1;
			   FOR j in iterator .. array_length
			   LOOP
					IF (i != user_ids[j]) THEN
						INSERT INTO single_league_matches(player_one, player_two, league_id, start_time, end_time, player_one_score, player_two_score, match_ended, match_paused, match_started)
						VALUES(i, user_ids[j], OLD.id, null, null, 0, 0, false, false, false);
					END IF;
			   END LOOP;
			END LOOP;
		END LOOP;
	end if;
	RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER create_single_league_matches
AFTER UPDATE
ON leagues
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE create_single_league_matches();
```

## end_single_league_match()

When the match is ended the database updates the current timestamp to the end_time field

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION end_single_league_match()
RETURNS trigger AS
$$
BEGIN
	if (NEW.match_ended = true and OLD.match_ended = false) then
		update single_league_matches
		SET end_time = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
		where id = old.id;
	end if;
	RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER end_single_league_match
AFTER UPDATE
ON single_league_matches
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE end_single_league_match();
```

## start_single_league_match

When a match is started the database updates the current timestamp to the start_time field

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION start_single_league_match()
RETURNS trigger AS
$$
BEGIN
	if (NEW.match_started = true and OLD.match_started = false and old.player_one_score = 0 and old.player_two_score = 0) then
		update single_league_matches
		SET start_time = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
		where id = old.id;
	end if;
	RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER end_single_league_match
AFTER UPDATE
ON single_league_matches
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE end_single_league_match();
```

## delete_single_league_goal

When a single league goal is deleted we want to update the score in the single_league_matches table
OBS!! This trigger was removed. Was making a mess. See if it is possible to have this trigger used
with AFTER DELETE instead of BEFORE DELETE

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_single_league_goal()
RETURNS trigger AS
$$
DECLARE
  user_who_scored integer := null;
  the_match_id integer := null;
  player_one_id integer := null;
  player_two_id integer := null;
BEGIN
    SELECT scored_by_user_id into user_who_scored FROM single_league_goals where id = OLD.id;
	SELECT match_id into the_match_id FROM single_league_goals where id = OLD.id;

	if (user_who_scored is not NULL) then
	    SELECT player_one into player_one_id FROM single_league_matches where id = the_match_id;
		SELECT player_two into player_two_id FROM single_league_matches where id = the_match_id;

		if (player_one_id = user_who_scored) then
			update single_league_matches
			SET player_one_score = player_one_score - 1
			where id = the_match_id;
		end if;

		if (player_two_id = user_who_scored) then
			update single_league_matches
			SET player_two_score = player_two_score - 1
			where id = the_match_id;
		end if;

	end if;
RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER delete_single_league_goal
BEFORE DELETE
ON single_league_goals
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE delete_single_league_goal();
```

## create_double_league_matches

This function creates double_league_matches after update on the leagues table

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_double_league_matches()
RETURNS trigger AS
$$
DECLARE
	team_ids integer[] := null;
	array_length integer;
    counterMax integer := 2;
	counter integer := 0;
	i integer;
    iterator integer := 0;
BEGIN
   if (NEW.has_league_started = true and OLD.has_league_started = false and old.type_of_league = 'double_league') then
   		SELECT INTO team_ids array_agg(dlt.id) FROM double_league_teams dlt WHERE dlt.league_id = OLD.id;
		SELECT INTO array_length count(dlt.id) FROM double_league_teams dlt WHERE dlt.league_id = OLD.id;
		SELECT INTO counterMax how_many_rounds FROM leagues WHERE id = OLD.id;
		if (counterMax is NULL) then
			counterMax := 2;
		end if;
			counterMax := counterMax * 2;
			LOOP
				exit when counter = counterMax;
				counter := counter + 1 ;
				iterator := 0;
				FOREACH i IN ARRAY team_ids
				LOOP
				iterator := iterator + 1;
				   FOR j in iterator .. array_length
				   LOOP
						IF (i != team_ids[j]) THEN
							INSERT INTO double_league_matches(team_one_id, team_two_id, league_id, start_time, end_time, team_one_score, team_two_score, match_started, match_ended, match_paused)
							VALUES(i, team_ids[j], OLD.id, null, null, 0, 0, false, false, false);
						END IF;
				   END LOOP;
				END LOOP;
			END LOOP;
   end if;
RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER create_double_league_matches
AFTER UPDATE
ON leagues
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE create_double_league_matches();

```

## add_double_league_goal

This function updates the double_league_matches table after update on double_league_goals table

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER add_double_league_goal
AFTER INSERT
ON double_league_goals
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE add_double_league_goal();




CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_double_league_goal()

you cant access swagger html page from docker, beacause its in production and swagger only works in development
